            <h1>When Great Trees Fall</h1>
            <h4>MAYA ANGELOU</h4>

            <p style="font-size: small; line-height: 1.5em;">When great trees fall,
                rocks on distant hills shudder,
                lions hunker down
                in tall grasses,
                and even elephants
                lumber after safety.
                
                When great trees fall
                in forests,
                small things recoil into silence,
                their senses
                eroded beyond fear.
                
                When great souls die,
                the air around us becomes
                light, rare, sterile.
                We breathe, briefly.
                Our eyes, briefly,
                see with
                a hurtful clarity.
                Our memory, suddenly sharpened,
                examines,
                gnaws on kind words
                unsaid,
                promised walks
                never taken.
                
                Great souls die and
                our reality, bound to
                them, takes leave of us.
                Our souls,
                dependent upon their
                nurture,
                now shrink, wizened.
                Our minds, formed
                and informed by their
                radiance,
                fall away.
                We are not so much maddened
                as reduced to the unutterable ignorance
                of dark, cold
                caves.
                
                And when great souls die,
                after a period peace blooms,
                slowly and always
                irregularly. Spaces fill
                with a kind of
                soothing electric vibration.
                Our senses, restored, never
                to be the same, whisper to us.
                They existed. They existed.
                We can be. Be and be
                better. For they existed.

            <h1>(Almost): The Essence of Everything</h1>
            <h4>By Andrea Jenkins</h4>

            <p>what happened
                at the           end of
                everything
                speculators picking over the remains
                like panicky stricken crackheads in the evening rain
                
                hovering----snorting
                two times strong
                
                this         is                                           nothing
                
                like I thought it would
                be-----all shills and tangled
                vines, withered grapes
                descended to the cracked earth
                
                parched, bloodstained earth
                
                but there was sun still shining
                there were Sunflowers
                and we drank Sun tea
                and wore Sundresses with matching parasols
                I became Sun-blind
                
                at other times I imagine the end
                of everything to be
                
                nothing
                
                like what you believed to
                be your responsibility
                
                I thought the poet
                would have
                nothing
                
                to say at the end of
                everything, “it has all
                been said” I thought
                she would say
                
                she began to chant (blue, yellow, red, green)
                (blue, yellow, red, green)
                and moan            soon
                words poured freely like blood from
                a wounded heart and
                nothing
                
                could stop the bleeding
                her phrases oxidized
                on the page
                disappearing in thin air until
                nothing
                
                was left.
            
           
            </p>

    <h1>December</h1>
    <h4>By Michael Miller</h4>
    <p>I want to be a passenger
        in your car again
        and shut my eyes
        while you sit at the wheel,
        
        awake and assured
        in your own private world,
        seeing all the lines
        on the road ahead,
        
        down a long stretch
        of empty highway
        without any other
        faces in sight.
        
        I want to be a passenger
        in your car again
        and put my life back
        in your hands.
